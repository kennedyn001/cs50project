# cs50project
A project done for cs50 course.

My cs50 final project This project is called E-library management system.

It helps to manage most of the library operations such as renting books and keeps track of important dates

such as the expiry date. It also helps librarians to keep track of every book in store and whoever rented it

and exactly when it has to be returned. Moreover, it calculates the fine for each day a book is not returned

in time.

To run it, just type from command flask run and install required library and you will be good to go.
NB: It was developed using linux os. Requirements may differ for other OS.


users just need to create an account and then they can start using the system right away.

It was made using python and javascript and html as programming languages.

It was styled with css.

Created in september 2020 by Samuel Guy Kenned NIYOBUHUNGIRO as a CS50 final project.

Thanks to every instructor of cs50 Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard for the skills they have been

providing to other students like me.
